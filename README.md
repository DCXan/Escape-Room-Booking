# Flashbook
An all-in-one Escape Room management tool with scheduling and booking services.

* **Purpose of the App:** 

   Flashbook was created for a client who needed a service that would allow them to manage an escape room business. The client needed to be able to create and set the room details, set the availability schedule for each room, give customers the ability to view available timeslots, and allow customers to select a timeslot and purchase tickets. The admin dashboard allows the client to view orders as well as customer information. Payments are handled by Stripe.

* **Features of the App:**
   * Separate customer and dealer accounts log in from the same interface but are directed to different dashboards.
   * Dealers can easily manage their inventory by adding and deleting vehicles.
   * Car requests are automatically filtered based on a dealer's inventory so that dealers can just see the requests that they are able to fulfill.
   * A customer can receive multiple offers from different dealers on the same request. Once the customer accepts an offer, the request is removed for all dealers.
